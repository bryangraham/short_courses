    "This is the fourth of a series of iPython Jupyter notebooks originally written to accompany a series of instructional lectures given at Charles University on August 6th and 7th, 2019. The scripts below were written for Python 3.6. The Anaconda distribution of Python, available at https://www.continuum.io/downloads, comes bundled with most the scientific computing packages used in these notebooks.\n",

    "This notebook provides an implementation of the Blitztein and Diaconis (2010) method for constucting uniform random draws from the set of all adjacency matrices with fixed degree sequences. This code was initially derived from an R implementation by Joseph Blitztein available at this [website](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~blitz/Site/Research_files/GraphAlgorithmR.txt). Seonjoo Min provided an initial translation Joseph Blitztein's implementation to Python. What appears in this notebook is a revision of this initial translation to take advantage of additional Python functionality (e.g., routines available in the _networkx_ package). I am also grateful to Andrin Pelican for identifying some errors in an earlier version of this notebook.\n",
