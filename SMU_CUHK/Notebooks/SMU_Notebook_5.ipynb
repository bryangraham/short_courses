    "This is the fifth in a series of iPython Jupyter notebooks designed to accompany a series of instructional lectures given at the Singapore Management University (SMU) from May 29th to June 1st, 2017. The scripts below were written for Python 2.7.12. The Anaconda distribution of Python, available at https://www.continuum.io/downloads, comes bundled with most the scientific computing packages used in these notebooks.\n",

    "For more information about the course please visit my webpage at http://bryangraham.github.io/econometrics/. This notebook also provides a basic illustration of the recently introduced _netrics_ Python package for the econometric analysis of network data. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "I begin by importing several key packages. The _numpy_ and _scipy_ libraries include a core set of scientific computing tools. The _pandas_ package is useful for data organization and analysis, while _matplotlib_ is Python's basic plotting add-on. Finally the _networkx_ package includes functionality for the analysis, and also visualizing, network data."

    "Relative to the *tetrad\\_logit()* results, the joint estimator suggests sorting by religion and clan. In Monte Carlo experiments I have found that the joint estimator -- particularly the bias correction step -- can work very poorly in networks like the Nyakatoke one (i.e., in networks that are sparse such that many agents have only a few links). In such settings the $A_{i}$ for $i=1,...,N$ may be _very_ imprecisely estimated and this can effect the quality of the common parameter estimates as well.\n",

This suggests, that in this particular example, bias-correction may be doing more harm that good.\n",
