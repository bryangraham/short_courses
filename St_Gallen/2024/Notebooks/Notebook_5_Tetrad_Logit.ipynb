In Monte Carlo experiments I have found that the joint estimator -- particularly the bias correction step -- can work very poorly in networks like the Nyakatoke one (i.e., in networks that are sparse such that many agents have only a few links). In such settings the $A_{i}$ for $i=1,...,N$ may be _very_ imprecisely estimated and this can effect the quality of the common parameter estimates as well.\n",

This suggests, that in this particular example, bias-correction may be doing more harm that good.\n",
