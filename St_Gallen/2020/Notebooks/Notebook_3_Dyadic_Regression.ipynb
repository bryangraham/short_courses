    "## Dyadic regression and the gravity model of international trade\n",
    "\n",
    "Jo√£o Santos Silva and Silvana Tenreyro (2006, _Review of Economics and Statistics_) advocate the application of Poisson regression methods to the analysis of trade flows across countries. Their work has been influential in the empirical trade literature. Google Scholar calls their work a \"classic paper\" in economics (see this [blog post](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2017/06/classic-papers-articles-that-have-stood.html) for more information on Google Scholar \"classic papers\"). An open access copy of the paper can be found [here](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest.88.4.641). Replication data and additional information about the dataset used in the paper can be found [here](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/tenreyro/lgw.html).    \n",

    "In this notebook we will use the Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) dataset to illustrate our results on estimation and inference of dyadic regression models. The dataset is located in the \"data\" directory of the Github repository. You'll need to download the data and adjust the **data** directory defined below to run this notebook on your computer.\n",

    "The **dyadic_regression()** function fits simple linear, logistic and poisson regression models to dyadic data by the method of (dyadic or pairwise) composite maximum likelihood estimation. The function can accommodate directed outcomes, in which case a total of N(N-1) directed outcomes are observed (with N the number of agents), as well as undirected outcomes, in which case 0.5N(N-1) outcomes are observed. The program does not, as of yet, accommodate the presence of missing outcomes.    \n",

All three of these methods are described in the forthcoming _Handbook of Econometrics_ chapter on networks by Graham (forthcoming). The first method assumes independence (conditional on covariates) across dyads. In the case of directed outcome data this does allow for dependence of $ Y_{ij} $ with $ Y_{ji} $ but rules out dependence between, say, $ Y_{ij} $ with $ Y_{ik} $. The other two estimators allow for dependence across any two dyads sharing at least one agent in common. The first of these corresponds to the Jackknife estimate of the leading term in the asymptotic variance of $ \\sqrt{N}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta_{0}\\right) $. The second estimate is a bias corrected variance estimate which also includes (estimates of) higher order variance terms."

The columns in the table correspond to the three parameters in the model, the rows to the three variance estimators.   \n",
