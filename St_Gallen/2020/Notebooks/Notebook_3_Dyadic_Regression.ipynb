    "\n",
    "João Santos Silva and Silvana Tenreyro (2006, _Review of Economics and Statistics_) advocate the application of Poisson regression methods to the analysis of trade flows across countries. Their work has been influential in the empirical trade literature. Google Scholar calls their work a \"classic paper\" in economics (see this [blog post](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2017/06/classic-papers-articles-that-have-stood.html) for more information on Google Scholar \"classic papers\"). An open access copy of the paper can be found [here](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/rest.88.4.641). Replication data and additional information about the dataset used in the paper can be found [here](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/tenreyro/lgw.html).    \n",

    "In this notebook we will use the Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) dataset to illustrate our results on estimation and inference of dyadic regression models. The dataset is located in the \"data\" directory of the Github repository. You'll need to download the data and adjust the **data** directory defined below to run this notebook on your computer.\n",

In the case of directed outcome data this does allow for dependence of $ Y_{ij} $ with $ Y_{ji} $ but rules out dependence between, say, $ Y_{ij} $ with $ Y_{ik} $. The other two estimators allow for dependence across any two dyads sharing at least one agent in common. The first of these corresponds to the Jackknife estimate of the leading term in the asymptotic variance of $ \\sqrt{N}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta_{0}\\right) $. The second estimate is a bias corrected variance estimate which also includes (estimates of) higher order variance terms."

    "The following table reports Monte Carlo coverage estimates for Wald type nominal 95 percent confidence intervals based on the three variance estimates available in **dyadic_regression()**. The first assumes independence across dyads ('ind'), the second is the jackknife estimate ('DR'), and the third a bias corrected estimate ('DR_bc'). These last two allow for dependence across dyads sharing at least one agent in common. The columns in the table correspond to the three parameters in the model, the rows to the three variance estimators.   \n",

    "The standard error associated with a Monte Carlo coverage estimate is $\\sqrt{\\alpha\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)/B}$. With $B = 1,000$ simulations and $\\alpha = 0.05$ this results in a standard error of approximately 0.007 or a 95 percent confidence interval of $[0.936, 0.964]$. Hence the 'ind' standard errors significantly undercover, while the 'DR' standard errors (sometimes) significantly overcover. The 'DR_bc' have actual coverage (almost) insignificantly different from target coverage."
